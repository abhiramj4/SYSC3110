# SYSC3110
Repo for term project

The goal of this team project is to implement a puzzle version of the game Plants vs Zombies

The basic idea of the game is that you drop plants with various magical powers in your
garden to defend against invading zombies. One plant, the sunflower, gives you “sun”
points that you can use to buy more plants. Other plants shoot at the zombies at various
time intervals or damage points. Other plants prevent or slow down the advance of the
zombies. Plants have a different cost in “sun” points depending on their type. Also, once
you drop a plant you must wait some time before plants of its type are available again for
planting. This wait time also varies depending on the type of plant. There are also
different kinds of zombies: some more resistant to damage, some faster, some that aren’t
slowed down by certain obstacles, some that have weapons of their own, etc. When a
zombie gets near a plant, it starts chewing on it until the plant is destroyed.

Milestone 1: A text-based (i.e., console-based input and textual representation), barebones
but playable version of the game (sunflowers, one other type of plant, one type of
zombie, just one level), UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagrams, sequence
diagrams, complete variable and method signatures), detailed description of the choice of
data structures and relevant operations: you are providing an initial design and
implementation for the Model part of the MVC. Do not worry about any GUI yet.
• Deliverables: readme file (see explanation below) + code + UML diagrams +
documentation, all in one zip file.
• Deadline: Wednesday Oct 23rd.
