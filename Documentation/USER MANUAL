INTRO
-----

This is a "tower" defense game where homeowners use a variety of different plants to prevent an army of zombies from entering their house and eating their brains


This is a turn based game, not real time. Each 'turn', you can call multiple commands as to what you want to do.



RULES

The game is set in the player's lawn, which is divided into a 4 x 8 grid

Zombies move along lanes and towards the player's house, they must be defeated using plants.

Planting plants costs sun, which varies between plants. Sun is recieved through the sunflower plant, and is also recieved periodically 

Once a zombie reaches your last lawn tile, the game is over - your objective is to prevent this!!

VALID COMMANDS

To plant, follow this command: Plant <PLANTTYPE> at (<x>, <y>). As of now, you may only plant a sunflower and a peashooter. You may only use an x value from 0 to 8 and a y value from 0 to 4. The command must also be followed exactly, or the command will not be registered.
