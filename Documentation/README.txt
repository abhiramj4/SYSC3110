GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-------------------

- This text based version of plants vs. zombies is turn-based. Each turn you can choose between various commands and advance turns accordingly.
- There is only one level, good luck though it's not easy

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- One issue we have right now is that in the real game zombies can "pile up" and attack plants together. Our version of the game kind of have the zombies kind of line up behind each other instead of stacking on the same square. This should be something we can fix when we make the game realtime.

ROADMAP AHEAD
-------------
- We must design more levels using our JSON object level implementation method. 

INSTALLATION 
------------
- Simply
